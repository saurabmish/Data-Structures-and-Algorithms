## Quick Sort

*Worst Case*: O(n^2)

*Average Case*: O(nlogn)

Quick sort will exhibit worst case performance when *the* most unbalanced partition is produced. This happens when one of the sublists returned by the `partition` routine is of size (n âˆ’ 1). This may happen if the pivot happens to be the smallest or largest element.

To reduce the possibility of the pivot being the smallest or largest element, a random element should be chosen as pivot. The code in this repository uses the middle element as the pivot. Other options include selecting a random element as pivot, or choosing the median of the first, middle and last element as pivot.

Best case is when a balanced partition is produced - both sublists are nearly equal size.
Quick sort is an in-place sorting algorithm and does not require extra space. This is because the positions of data is swapped in the `partition` function.
