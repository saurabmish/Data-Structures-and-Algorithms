# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures & Algorithms with comprehensive testing, coverage, and cross-platform continuous integration.

The goal of this repository is to smoothly transition from one problem to another, document interesting aspects, and cover a good number of practical problems.

## Data Structures

+ Stack

+ Queue

+ Linked List

+ Tree

+ Heap

+ Graph


## Algorithm Design Paradigms

+ Divide and Conquer

+ Greedy

+ Dynamic Programming
